<h2>SustainWear: A Smart Clothes Donation and Sustainability Platform</h2>

<p>SustainWear is a proposed responsive web-based system aimed at promoting sustainability through
structured clothes donation. The platform will connect individuals, charities, and organisations to
streamline the process of donating, categorising, and redistributing clothing. The platform may utilise
AI service to categorise clothes automatically based on type, condition, or seasonality. The system
will feature tailored dashboards for different user roles, including donors, charity staff, and system
administrators, allowing each role to track donations, manage inventories, and monitor sustainability
goals</p>
